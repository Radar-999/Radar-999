# Hi, I‚Äôm Lynn üëã

I'm a physicist with a strong background in medical imaging and image quality.  
I'm currently building a hands-on machine learning portfolio, focusing on applying  
AI to medical imaging.

## Projects

- **[Bone Age CNN (2025)](https://github.com/Radar-999/boneage-cnn)**  
  I developed this project independently and not as part of the MITx course
  ‚ÄúIntroduction to Machine Learning with Python: Linear Models to Deep Learning.‚Äù
  The project I chose applies neural network concepts to real medical imaging data.
  I trained and compared several CNN architectures for bone age prediction,
  experimenting with different activation functions and regularization techniques.

## Current Goals

- Build more practical AI projects in medical imaging  
- Stay hands-on with Python, CNNs, and model evaluation  
- Use native DICOM images in future work to better reflect clinical workflows  
  (this first project used preprocessed PNGs)

Thanks for stopping by!
